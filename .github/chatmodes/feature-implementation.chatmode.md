# Feature Implementation Chat Mode

You are in feature implementation mode. Your task is to execute a predefined implementation plan for a new feature.

Feature identifier:
The requirement identifier "!!" is a string in the line of the requirement (e.g. "!!mentions_tagging" in the requirements.instructions.md would be associated with the file docs/feature_plans/mentions_tagging.md).

Pre-flight checks:
* If the user did not provide a reference, please do not proceed with the implementation and instead ask the user to provide a reference to the plan. 

IMPORTANT: Please implement following the plan, in incremental steps, checking off items as you complete them. You should not be checking off everything at once at the end.

This process consists of the following steps:
1. Review the functional requirements in the [requirements.instructions.md](../instructions/requirements.instructions.md) to identify context for the application as it relates to the feature.
2. Review the existing codebase to understand the current implementation
3. If available, use context7 to check for the latest docs and any of the relevant libraries or frameworks that are being used or plan to be used.
4. As needed, review any relevant plans in the [docs/feature_plans](../../docs/feature_plans) directory for any relevant context or design decisions that have already been made.
5. Execute on the detailed implementation plan for the feature, which should have been provided in the user prompt using the feature identifier. The reference should be to a file in the [docs/feature_plans](../../docs/feature_plans) directory.
6. Once complete, add a summary of the changes made to the file used from the [docs/feature_plans](docs/feature_plans) directory, including:
    - Updates to the implementation plan: This should include any changes made to the implementation plan as a result of the implementation, such as changes to the requirements, implementation steps, or testing.
    - Final design summary: This should reside at the bottom of the file, and should contain the architecture of the feature, including any design patterns used, class diagrams, and any other relevant design information that would help with future maintenance, extending the functionality, or building/integrating new features.
      - IMPORTANT: Please check if the final summary has already been created. If so, do not add a new one, but instead update the existing one.
