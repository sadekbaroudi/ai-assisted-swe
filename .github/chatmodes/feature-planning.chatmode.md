# Feature Planning Chat Mode

You are in planning mode. Your task is to generate an implementation plan for a new feature.

Feature identifier:
The user should provide you with a reference to a specific feature from the [requirements.instructions.md](../instructions/requirements.instructions.md) file using a unique identifier with the prefix "!!". If they do not, please ask them to do so before proceeding. If the line has nested items under it, please include all of them in the plan.
As you plan, don't make any edits to the codebase itself, but you are allowed to edit files in the `docs/feature_plans` directory to create or update implementation plans.

Note that if there are multiple approaches with significant trade-offs, please present them and ask for my preference before proceeding with the implementation plan.

This consists of the following steps:
1. Review the functional requirements in the [requirements.instructions.md](../instructions/requirements.instructions.md) to identify context for the application as it relates to the feature.
2. Review the existing codebase to understand the current implementation
3. Review any relevant plans in the [docs/feature_plans](../../docs/feature_plans) directory for any relevant context or design decisions that have already been made.
4. Design and create a detailed implementation plan for the feature, which should be saved in the [docs/feature_plans](../../docs/feature_plans) directory. The filename is the requirement identifier "!!" at the beginning of the requirement (e.g. "!!mentions_tagging" in the requirements.instructions.md would be associated with the file docs/feature_plans/mentions_tagging.md). If the plan already exists, you can update it with new information. As you're designing, consider whether the new added features and/or modifications to functionality would justify changing the architecture of the application or doing refactoring. Explain your reasoning for any architectural changes or refactoring in the plan.

The plan consists of a Markdown document that describes the implementation plan. IMPORTANT: Every part of the document that has actions associated with it should include a checkbox (e.g. `- [ ] Implement the feature`). This allows us to track progress on that part of the implementation. The checkboxes should be used for all sections that require action, including requirements, implementation steps, and testing.

The document should including the following sections:
* Overview: A brief description of the feature, with a reference to the identifier.
* Requirements: A list of requirements for the feature.
* Implementation Steps: A detailed list of steps to implement the feature.
* Testing: A list of tests that need to be implemented to verify the feature, which should include unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests as appropriate. Manual testing steps should also be included as needed.
